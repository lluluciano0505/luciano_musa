title: "30-Day Map Challenge 2025"
---

Every November, cartographers and spatial data enthusiasts around the world take on the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) — one map per day, each following a daily theme. This is my 2025 entry, made as part of the MUSA program at the University of Pennsylvania's Weitzman School of Design.

18 maps. 18 themes. Some took an hour, some took a whole evening. All of them were an excuse to explore a new dataset, try a new technique, or just make something that looked interesting on a screen at midnight.

Here's a quick run through what I made:

**Day 1 — Points:** Heritage trees in Amsterdam — mapping the city's protected and candidate trees as a quiet portrait of urban green memory.

**Day 2 — Lines:** The Bagua City street pattern of Tekes, Xinjiang — a city built around the eight trigrams of the I Ching, one of the few places in the world designed as a perfect octagonal grid.

**Day 3 — Polygons:** Philadelphia zoning — residential, multi-family, and commercial mixed-use districts, mapping the legal geography that shapes everyday life in the city.

**Day 4 — My Data:** Tracing my global footprints — a personal map of the cities I've called home across China, the UK, the Netherlands, and the US.

**Day 5 — Earth:** Iceland terrain and major rivers — a hillshade elevation model highlighting the island's dramatic volcanic landscape.

**Day 6 — Dimensions:** Golden Gate elevation in 3D hexagons — density and elevation of the Golden Gate area rendered as a spiked hexagonal grid in R.

**Day 7 — Accessibility:** Chicago road accessibility by foodbank coverage — mapping which streets fall within 500m of a foodbank, and which don't.

**Day 8 — Urban:** Utrecht city sprawling — building age composition across the city, showing how Utrecht expanded outward decade by decade.

**Day 9 — Analog:** Hydraulic structure of the Polder system in the Jianghan Plain and Yangtze River Basin — a hand-drawn map of one of China's oldest water management systems.

**Day 10 — Air:** Air traffic network from Cairo International Airport (CAI) — countries grouped by number of connected airports, visualizing CAI's global reach.

**Day 11 — Minimal:** Russia railways — a network of steel arteries across eleven time zones, stripped down to its essentials.

**Day 12 — Map from 2125:** Caspian Sea 2025→2125 — a speculative map of retreating shorelines based on current climate projections.

**Day 13 — 10-minute map:** Africa population density — fast, simple, and surprisingly revealing about where people actually live on the continent.

**Day 14 — OpenStreetMap:** Seoul convenience stores by brand (OSM) — mapping the hyper-dense convenience store landscape of Seoul, colored by chain.

**Day 15 — Fire:** Southeast Asia recently active volcanoes — locating and classifying volcanic activity across the ring of fire.

**Day 16 — Cell:** Beijing — a student's 2008 activity space — reconstructing movement patterns from memory and historical data.

**Day 17 — A new tool:** Confessional patchwork of early modern Central Europe — experimenting with a new visualization tool to map religious geography after the Reformation.

**Day 18 — Out of this world:** New Columbria — an imaginary new world, cartographically complete with mountain ranges, river systems, and coastlines that never existed.
