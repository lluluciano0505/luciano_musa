Philadelphia's housing market is deeply unequal — and this model makes that visible. Using 25,585 OPA property sales from 2023–2024, four progressively complex regression models were built, layering structural features, Census socioeconomics, spatial accessibility, and interaction terms.

The final model explains 61% of price variation. Living area, house age, healthcare proximity, and neighborhood income and education are dominant predictors. But the more revealing result: the model **systematically underpredicts in wealthy areas and overpredicts in disadvantaged ones** — suggesting official assessments may carry the same bias.

Prediction errors cluster spatially, pointing to neighborhood dynamics no regression captures. In high-unemployment areas, crime's negative impact on price shrinks — adding policing doesn't raise values when underlying economic conditions remain weak.
