Where do fire alarms happen most in Philadelphia, and can we predict where they're likely to happen next? This final project builds on the full arc of the course — combining spatial analysis, predictive modeling, and policy thinking — to examine fire alarm patterns across the city and what they reveal about urban risk.

The analysis maps the spatial distribution of fire alarms against building characteristics, neighborhood demographics, and housing age. Philadelphia's older housing stock, concentrated in specific neighborhoods, creates predictable patterns of fire risk that a well-designed early intervention program could address proactively.

The project culminates in a policy recommendation: a targeted inspection and retrofit program for high-risk properties, with resource allocation guided by the model's predictions. The recommendation is tested for racial equity to ensure the model doesn't replicate existing patterns of over-policing in communities of color.
