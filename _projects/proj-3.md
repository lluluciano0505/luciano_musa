tagline: '182 people. Years of GPS traces across Beijing. What does it take to go home — and when do people decide to keep exploring?'

The [Microsoft Geolife dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/geolife-gps-trajectory-dataset-user-guide/) records GPS trajectories from 182 users across several years in Beijing — millions of location points that, with the right processing, become stories about how people actually move through cities.

Raw coordinates are converted into structured visit events, classifying each stop as home or non-home. From there, home-based trips are reconstructed to ask two questions: **How does the probability of returning home evolve as a trip unfolds?** And do distinct mobility "types" emerge across users?

Hazard and survival models capture the return-home dynamics — showing that the pull toward home shifts predictably over the course of a day. User-level clustering then groups people by their mobility signatures, revealing that routine and exploration are not uniformly distributed across a population.
