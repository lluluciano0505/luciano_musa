# Jingqi Lu

Hi, I'm Jingqi — a graduate student in [Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA)](https://www.design.upenn.edu/musa) at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm maintaining a 4.0 GPA and spending most of my time thinking about cities, data, and the space between them.

I grew up in China, studied in London, did an exchange in Amsterdam, and now live in Philadelphia. Moving between cities has made me genuinely curious about how they work — why some neighborhoods feel connected and others don't, who gets to move freely and who doesn't, and how the patterns we see on a map reflect decisions made (or not made) decades ago. That curiosity is what pulled me toward urban data science.

## What I Work On

My research interests sit at the intersection of **spatial data science**, **agent-based modelling**, and **urban equity**. I'm particularly drawn to questions about mobility and access — how people navigate cities, what barriers shape those movements, and how we can use computation to surface inequalities that are easy to miss in aggregate statistics.

On the technical side, I work extensively with Python (pandas, geopandas, scikit-learn), R, SQL, and ArcGIS. I also work with deep learning methods (CNN, Mask R-CNN, U-Net/PSPNet) for spatial imagery analysis, and I've been exploring how large language models can augment geospatial workflows — extracting meaning from unstructured urban data that traditional methods struggle with.

Right now I'm collaborating with [Henning Larsen](https://henninglarsen.com/) in Philadelphia on a project that asks: how do architectural teams actually use data, and how can we make that process more systematic? I'm building a Python-based data auditing tool and a structured taxonomy for evaluating urban datasets — bridging IoT sensors, satellite imagery, mobility traces, and design decision-making in a reproducible way.

## Background

I completed my BA in Geography with Social Data Science at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where I developed a foundation in spatial econometrics, cartography, and machine learning for social science. During my final year I did an Erasmus exchange at the **University of Amsterdam**, focusing on migration dynamics and political geography — which pushed me to think more carefully about the *politics* embedded in spatial data, not just the methods.

Before coming to Penn, I worked as a data analysis assistant at Hisense, cleaning and visualizing sales datasets, and spent a summer as an IELTS teaching assistant — which, as it turns out, taught me a lot about explaining complex ideas clearly. A skill that comes in handy more often than you'd think in data science.

## Outside the Lab

When I'm not debugging Python or wrestling with coordinate reference systems, I'm usually on a tennis court. I've played for years and coached part-time, and there's something about the combination of strategy and reflex that I find genuinely satisfying. I also play guitar — not particularly well, but with a lot of enthusiasm.

I've been slowly learning Dutch since my time in Amsterdam. It's a humbling experience. I speak English and Mandarin fluently, and I'm always happy to chat about cities, data, music, or why Amsterdam's bike infrastructure is the best thing humanity has ever built.
